## Docker Deep Dive Notes

1. Containers from 30,000 feet
    * What are containers, etc
    * Windows vs Linux

1.  Docker
    * Kubernetes - leading orchestrator, needed for managing deployment and running apps
    * Docker Engine - plumbing that runs and orchestrates containers
    * EE vs CE
    * Moby - tools that combine to make Docker daemon. Breaks dDOcekr into modular components. Big infra contributors. Golang.
        * Batteries included but removable
    * Open Container Initiative (OCI) - standardized image format and container runtime

1. Installing Docker: 
    - Windows, Mac, Windows Server 2016, Ubuntu, Docker EE, etc
    - Upgrading Docker: 
        - make sure containers have restart policy, 
        - drain nodes if needed (using Swarm mode). 
        - Steps: 
            - Stop Docker daemon, remove old version, install new version, configure new version to auto start when system boots, ensure containers restarted.
    - Docker and storage drivers
        - Every Docker container gets an area of local storage where image layers are stacked and the container filesystem is mounted. By default this is where all container read/write ops occur, making it integral to the perf and stability of every container.
        - Local storage area has been managed by storage driver, which are sometiomes called the graph driver. Docker supports several different storage drivers, each which implements layering and copy-on-write in its own way - impacting perf and stability.
          - Some available drivers:
              - aufs (the original and oldest)
              - overlay2 (probably best choice for future)
              - devicemapper
              - btrfs
              - zfs
          - Windows only supports windowsfilter driver

1. The Big Picture
    - Ops perspective 
        - Docker client, 
        - daemon/engine, 
        - images, running containers
        - attaching to running containers
      - Dev perspective - containerize app

1. The Docker Engine

    Docker used to be made up of:

    - **Docker client**: a cli or lib that talks to the Docker daemon.

    - **Monolithic Docker daemon**: performed __***all***__ docker image workflow tasks and container creation tasks

    - **LXC**: a system-container solution tailored to the linux kernel

    This was not only a bad design, but there were some pretty terrible consequences (e.g. if you stop the docker daemon, all of your running containers are killed!). This lead to a major overhaul to break out the functionality into smaller components (using the UNIX philosophy).

    Docker is now made up of:

    - **Docker client** aka "docker": (unchanged)

    - **Docker daemon** aka "dockerd": responsible for the API, docker workflow tasks, security features, core networking, and volume management. (at least it's not "everything" like it used to be)

    - **containerd**: is a **container execution supervisor** which can manage a complete container lifecycle and enable runtime telemetry.

    - **containerd-shim**: a small process for invoking runc. This is used to keep the STDIO (and other FDs) open for the container incase containerd and/or docker both die. The Shim also reaps the container's exit status and reports the value back to containerd, all without having the be the actual parent of the container's process and do a wait4. This solves the "zombie" reaping problem that has plauged Docker for years.

    - **runc**: is lightweight universal container runtime. Runc is used by containerd for spawning and running containers according to OCI spec. It is essentially a CLI wrapper around libcontainer, the library that replaced LXC. Once the user process starts the runc process exits, allowing for a daemonless container configuration.


    How you start a container with this engine from the ground up:

    ```
    Client <==REST==> Daemon <==GRPC==> containerd > (fork+exec) > containerd-shim + runc > (exec) > your processes

    ```
